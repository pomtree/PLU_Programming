 * expect to make.
 * Input
 * The first line will contain a single integer n that indicates the number of data sets that follow. Each data set
 * will start with a single integer x denoting how many items follow. The next x lines consist of a string, and
 * integer, and a floating point number to two decimal places, representing the name of what was sold, the
 * quantity, and the unit price of each item.
 * Output
 * For each test case, output the amount of money you expect to make with all of the goods you sold, rounded
 * to two decimal places.
